When exporting the models to Wavefront .obj files,
make sure you set the options "Include Normals",
"Triangulate Faces", and "Keep Vertex Order".
The model has to have been set to have smooth
shading in Blender and double vertices have
to have been deleted before the export.
Otherwise, when rendering with shaders, lighting
will not work, since there will be multiple
normals for each vertex and, with indexed drawing,
the normals listed later in the exported file
for some vertices will overwrite the previous
ones.
If a texture has been created, the option "Include
UVs" must also be set.The texture should be saved
as a PNG file since this is the format that can
be read by the program.

Note that goatBB.blend is not meant to be used as a
typical model. It just contains two bounding boxes
for the goat, which have been manually created and
exported to samplegame/resources/models/GoatBB, only 
with the options "Apply Modifiers", "Include Edges", 
"Objects as OBJ Objects" and "Keep Vertex Order".
